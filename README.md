# 📚 Documentation Intelligence System

An autonomous agent designed to **generate, organize, and maintain documentation** across connected platforms such as Google Drive, Slack, and local storage systems.  
The system continuously learns from user interactions, keeps documents up-to-date, and provides a unified, searchable knowledge layer for teams and organizations.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The Documentation Intelligence System acts as a self-updating documentation hub.  
It automatically:

- Ingests documents from multiple sources (Drive, Slack exports, local files)
- Summarizes, tags, and embeds content for semantic search
- Detects outdated or conflicting documentation
- Suggests or performs updates using reflection and planning
- Exposes a conversational interface for fast knowledge retrieval
- Maintains a long-term memory of institutional information

Built as an **agentic system** using planning, memory, and reflection loops, with optional MCP tools for interoperability with other agents.

## 🧩 Architecture (High-Level)

- **Agent Framework:** LangGraph / CrewAI  
- **Connectors:** Google Drive API, Slack Web API, Local FS  
- **Knowledge Store:** Chroma / PGVector (for embeddings + metadata)  
- **Pipeline:** OCR → Text Extraction → Embedding → Tagging  
- **Reasoning Loop:**  
  - Planning (document tasks, update cycles)  
  - Reflection (detect errors, stale content, missing docs)  
  - Memory (semantic store + structured metadata)  
- **Outputs:** Markdown, Google Docs, Notion pages (coming soon)

## 🔍 Features

- Multi-source document ingestion  
- RAG-based summarization and document creation  
- Auto-detection of outdated or duplicated documents  
- Cross-platform syncing (Drive, Slack, local)  
- Conversational search interface  
- Agent-driven update recommendations

## 🎯 Why This Project?

Teams generate knowledge constantly — in chats, meetings, documents, and emails.  
But documentation becomes **outdated**, **scattered**, and **hard to maintain**.

This agent solves that by:
- Acting like an internal technical writer  
- Continuously capturing and updating knowledge  
- Keeping documentation reliable, fresh, and accessible

## 🛠️ Roadmap

-  Slack + Drive ingestion connectors  
-  Update detection pipeline  
-  Reflection loop for documentation quality  
-  Version tracking and change suggestions  
-  MCP tool wrapper for interoperability  
-  Dashboard for document health analytics
